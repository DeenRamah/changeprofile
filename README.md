The function formats a buzz count into a readable string with proper pluralization.
If count is 0, it returns "No buzz".
For counts other than zero:
count.toString().padStart(2, "0") converts the count to a string and pads it to ensure it has at least two digits.
count === 1 ? "Thread" : "buzz" determines the correct word to use based on whether the count is singular or plural.
The formatted count and the word are combined into a single string and returned.
These detailed comments should help clarify what each part of the code is doing and why it is there.
